Template library for reading SDM120 / SDM220 / SDM630 Modbus Energy meters.

Reading via Software Serial library (https://github.com/plerup/espsoftwareserial)<br>
and rs232<->rs485 converter with automatic flow direction control (look at hardware_sdm220.jpg)<br>
NOTE: Not work with simple max485-only converters because this lib does not control max485 DE/RE lines (at this moment)


Tested on wemos d1 mini->ESP8266 with Arduino 1.6.9 & 2.3.0 esp8266 core
