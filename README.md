Template library for reading SDM120 / SDM220 / SDM630 Modbus Energy meters.

Reading via Software Serial library (https://github.com/plerup/espsoftwareserial)<br>
and rs232<->rs485 converter with automatic flow direction control (look at hardware_sdm220.jpg)<br>
~~NOTE: Not work with simple max485-only converters because this lib does not control max485 DE/RE lines (at this moment)~~<br>
or with converters with additional pins for flow control, like MAX485. 
DE and RE pin must be connected together to one of esp pin and this pin must be passed when initializing the library:
```
SDM<4800, 12, 13, 14> sdm;  //SDM220T	baud, rx pin, tx pin, dere pin(optional for max485)
```


Tested on wemos d1 mini->ESP8266 with Arduino 1.6.9 & 2.3.0 esp8266 core
